# Dummy sample source code

This directory contains dummy sample programs for
Question 1 (1) of Homework 2b in various languages.

* `adfa.c` - C
* `adfa.java` - Java
* `adfa.py` - Python
* `adfa.hs` - Haskell
* `adfa.exs` - Elixir

All of these programs read a pair of a DFA M and a string w
and always output "Yes." (That is, they are dummies.)

Note: "adfa" stands for "the acceptance problem for DFA."
See Theorem 4.1 (p.168) in the textbook.
